# Add Commas to a Number

We're going write a function `addCommas` that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns a string representation with commas inserted in the appropriate places.

For example:

```javascript
addCommas(100);         // => '100'
addCommas(5491);        // => '5,491'
addCommas(12345);       // => '12,345'
addCommas(987654321); // => '987,654,321'
```

## Start Simple

Remember to start with simple examples! Do several examples by hand, i.e., with pen and paper and no computer. How do you know when you don't need to insert any commas? How do you decide when to insert a comma? Are you scanning the decimal from left-to-right or right-to-left?
